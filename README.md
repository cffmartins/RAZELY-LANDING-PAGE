<strong>Razely Landing Page - Final SCSS practice project ðŸ’»</strong>

This landing page was developed as part of the CSS/SCSS module in the Frontend Development course at EDIT. The assignment was to take the base project provided by the tutor and rework it â€” improving both responsiveness and visual appeal while applying best practices in SCSS.

<strong>Highlights</strong>
- Built with a mobile-first mindset, ensuring seamless adaptation across all screen sizes
- A scalable SCSS setup, broken into partials for clarity and maintainability
- Use of a lot of SCSS (variables, mixins, and custom functions to streamline styling)
- Layouts crafted with a mix of Flexbox and Grid
